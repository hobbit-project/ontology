HOBBIT ontologyis described in this repository. 
The ontology is used to describe the benchmarking of systems including:

- Benchmarks with their parameters and features
- Systems and their features
- The experiments in which a single system is benchmarked with a certain benchmark
- The results of an experiment
- Additional information that is needed to rerun the same experiment again, e.g., the hardware on which the experiment has been carried out
